# To solve the project of creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game in JavaScript, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a JavaScript object to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board. This object should have a property for each of the nine squares on the board, and each property should be initialized to an empty string.

2. Write a function to start a new game. This function should reset the board object to its initial state.

3. Write a function to check if a square is empty. This function should take the square's coordinates as input and return true if the square is empty, and false otherwise.

4. Write a function to place a mark (X or O) in a square. This function should take the square's coordinates and the mark as input and update the board object accordingly.

5. Write a function to check if there is a winner. This function should check all possible winning combinations (rows, columns, and diagonals) to see if any player has three marks in a row. If so, the function should return the name of the winning player, and null otherwise.
